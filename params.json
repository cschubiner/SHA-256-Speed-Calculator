Results are returned in millions of hashes calculated per second.\r\n\r\nYou can use this information to figure out your expected profits gained by mining bitcoins. See here:\r\nhttp://tpbitcalc.appspot.com/\r\n\r\nFor reference, my 2011 Macbook Pro can generate about 45 million hashes per second, yielding an estimate of 7447.2 days to mine one block!\r\n\r\n![Sample run of the SHA-256 Speed Calculator](https://raw.github.com/cschubiner/SHA-256-Speed-Calculator/master/screenshot.png \"Sample run of the SHA-256 Speed Calculator\")","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
